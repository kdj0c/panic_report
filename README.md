# Panic Report

This project is a web front-end that decodes the data from a QR code generated by the Linux kernel drm panic.
This is a simple demo, so that Linux distributions that want to use drm panic with QR-code can re-use this code.

## Drm panic

Drm panic is a new feature in Linux v6.10, that allows to display a panic screen when a kernel panic occurs.

QR code support was merged in Linux v6.12, and allows to compress kmsg with Zlib, and then encoded as a numeric segment.
This project decodes the numeric segment, and uncompress it to display the debug information on web site.

## Dependencies

This uses pako inflate 2.1.0 to uncompress Zlib
