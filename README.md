# Panic Report

This project is a web front-end that decodes the data from a QR code generated by the Linux kernel drm panic.
This is a simple demo, so that Linux distributions that want to use drm panic with QR-code can re-use this code.

## Drm panic

Drm panic is a new feature in Linux v6.10, that allows to display a panic screen when a kernel panic occurs.

There is a proposal, to put debug information in a QR code in the panic screen.
As a QR code can't encode enough data, the debug information is compressed with Zlib, and then encoded as a numeric segment.
This project decodes the numeric segment, and uncompress it to display the debug information on web site.

## Code source

Code source is located in docs/ because it allows github pages to work directly without changing the configuration.
I may fix that later.
